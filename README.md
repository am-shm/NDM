# download-manager
this is very minimal download manager written in bash !! [ just for unix-like systems :)) ]

# About
this downlowd manager written in bash script and it use wget for downloading files

# How to works
for single file to download you just have to first enter directory to save file and enter URL<br>
for multi files to download steps aresimilar last one with this different that you shuld put space beteween URLs, just this :))

# How it works
it store URLs in a string and then with a for loop it put "wget URL" in a temp file then run it with bash and after downloading files it remove the temp file 

# How to install
we add a script that when you run it, it copy dm executable file to your path and then you can run it frome everywhere by dm commannd or you can make alias for it

     git clone https://github.com/am-shm/download-manager.git
     cd download-manager
     chmod +x install.sh dm.sh
     ./install.sh
     
 # GUI version will add soon
